# Mock-Trial-Calculations

The following program is a GUI application, written in Python and targeting the Windows platform. It's purpose is to allow AMTA competitors to calculate a relative "individual score" for accurate comparisons across competitors. With a normalization to allow comparison of competitors with different numbers of scores on a given ballot. 

## Version

0.0.0

**Notice:** This application is prerelease version 0, the development process will continue to be pushed to github, but version numbers will not begin to increase until I feel the intial work has been updated in a satisfactory matter such that the previous work posted defined a distinct version. When I feel the program is ready for public release I will instance the version number to 1.0.0 and begin releasing executable files for supported OSes. While prerelease development will likely be rapid, it is both irresponsible and legally unfounded to take any release notes, blog posts, social media updates, or other statements of authors or contributors as a contract implying a set date of completion or legal deadlines of any kind.
